/**
 * 3. Lazy Expression Evaluation.
 *
 * A programming technique where the evaluation of an expression is postponed until its value is actually needed.
 * This is contrary to the usual "eager" evaluation, where expressions are evaluated as soon as they are encountered
 * in the code.
 *
 * In C++, lazy evaluation can be implemented using various techniques, including:
 *
 * 1. Deferred Computation: Computations are wrapped in a function or a functor, and this function is called only when
 *                          the result is needed. This is useful in scenarios where a computation might be expensive and
 *                          it's not certain if the result will be used.
 *
 * 2. Using Proxies: Involves creating proxy objects that represent the result of an expression. The actual computation
 *                   is only performed when the result is explicitly requested, typically when the proxy is converted to
 *                   the target type.
 *
 * 3. Thunks: A parameterless function that encapsulates a computation. When a thunk is called, it performs the computation
 *            and returns the result.
