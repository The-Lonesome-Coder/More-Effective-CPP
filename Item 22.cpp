/**
 * Efficiency Considerations:
 * The assignment versions of operators are typically more efficient than their stand-alone versions, as they donâ€™t
 * require the construction and destruction of temporary objects. By offering both types of operators, class users can
 * choose between writing concise code using stand-alone operators or more efficient, though possibly less intuitive,
 * code using assignment operators.
 *
 *
 * Return Value Optimization (RVO):
 * The article discusses the implementation details of operator overloading with a focus on efficiency, particularly
 * concerning RVO. The use of named versus unnamed objects in the return statements of operator functions affects the
 * compiler's ability to apply RVO. Historically, unnamed objects have been easier for compilers to optimize away,
 * potentially making them more efficient than named objects, although this may vary with different compilers and their
 * capabilities.
 *
 *
 * Library Design and Application Development:
 * For library designers, the recommendation is to provide both assignment and stand-alone versions of operators to
 * offer flexibility and efficiency to users. Application developers are advised to prefer assignment operators over
 * stand-alone ones for performance-critical code.
